Prototype #1:
For my first prototype, I focused on trap-filled dungeons to explore the mechanics of the "Ancient Technology" concept. This prototype features puzzles involving statues, unlocking pathways, opening doors, hidden floors, and other similar elements. The gameplay is designed in a classic 80s style, emphasizing mechanics-based puzzles.
