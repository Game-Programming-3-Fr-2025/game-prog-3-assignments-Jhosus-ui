Prototype #1:
For my first prototype, I focused on trap-filled dungeons to explore the mechanics of the "Ancient Technology" concept. This prototype features puzzles involving statues, unlocking pathways, opening doors, hidden floors, and other similar elements. The gameplay is designed in a classic 80s style, emphasizing mechanics-based puzzles.

Prototype #2:
For this second prototype, our theme was "Falling," so I opted for a simple concept: a 2D platformer game where the player has to climb to the top, carefully timing their movements and jumps to avoid falling and losing.  The game has three levels, each of which unlocks a new ability to overcome additional obstacles.
